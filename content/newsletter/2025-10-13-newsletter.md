- [Quoting Slashdot](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/12/slashdot/#atom-tag) — The Slashdot article highlights a peculiar limitation in Microsoft's OneDrive, where users can only change a specific setting three times a year, a policy Microsoft's publicist did not explain. The text also lists recent articles, including one about the AI model Claude's ability to write Datasette plugins and coverage of OpenAI DevDay 2025.

- [Agents 2.0: From Shallow Loops to Deep Agents](https://www.philschmid.de/agents-2.0-deep-agents) — The article details the evolution of AI agent design from "Shallow Agents" (Agent 1.0) to "Deep Agents" (Agent 2.0), highlighting the limitations of the former in handling complex, multi-step tasks due to context overflow and state management issues. Deep Agents overcome these challenges by adopting a proactive architecture built on four pillars: explicit planning using external tools, hierarchical delegation to specialized sub-agents, persistent memory external to the context window (like filesystems or vector databases), and extreme context engineering for detailed instructions, enabling them to tackle significantly more intricate problems effectively.
