- [ICPC medals for OpenAI and Gemini](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/17/icpc/#atom-tag) â€” AI models from OpenAI and Google DeepMind have achieved gold-medal level performance in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), following similar success in the International Math Olympiad. OpenAI's ensemble, featuring GPT-5 and an experimental reasoning model, solved all 12 problems, matching or exceeding the best human teams. Separately, Google DeepMind's advanced Gemini 2.5 Deep Think successfully solved 10 out of 12 problems under competition conditions. The author notes that previous AI competition successes did not involve tool usage and questions if tools were employed in these latest achievements.
