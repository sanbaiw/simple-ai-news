## Articles

- [Latest open artifacts (#15): It’s Qwen's world and we get to live in it, on CAISI's report, & GPT-OSS update](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/latest-open-models-15-its-qwens-world) — The article provides an update on the open-source AI ecosystem, emphasizing the renewed prominence of Qwen models. It scrutinizes a report from the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) for its evaluation of DeepSeek 3.1, highlighting discrepancies in SWE-bench Verified scores due to a weak harness and questioning CAISI's HuggingFace download statistics compared to ATOM Project's more stringent filtering methods. Furthermore, the piece notes the strong adoption of GPT-OSS models despite early challenges and reviews new releases, including IBM's Granite 4.0 hybrid models and the updated Qwen VL series, underscoring advancements and the complexities of hybrid reasoning approaches in model training.

- [Andrej Karpathy — AGI is still a decade away](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/18/agi-is-still-a-decade-away/#atom-tag) — Andrej Karpathy, in a conversation with Dwarkesh Patel, asserts that AGI-level "human-replacement" agents are still a decade away, contrasting with optimistic predictions, due to current AI models' cognitive deficits, lack of continual learning, and insufficient multimodal capabilities. He conceptualizes LLMs as "ghosts" or "spirits" that mimic human data rather than "animals" trained by evolution, suggesting a different form of intelligence. Karpathy explains that while agents like Claude and Codex excel at boilerplate code, they proved unhelpful for his unique nanochat project, struggling with its intellectually intense and non-boilerplate structure due to ingrained internet patterns.
