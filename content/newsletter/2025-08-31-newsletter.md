- [Claude Opus 4.1 and Opus 4 degraded quality](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/30/claude-degraded-quality/#atom-tag) — Anthropic confirmed a genuine quality degradation for its Claude Opus 4.1 and Claude Opus 4.0 models, lasting approximately 56.5 hours from August 25th to August 28th. This issue, which caused lower intelligence, malformed responses, and problems with tool calling (including in Claude Code), was attributed to a botched rollout of their inference stack, which has since been rolled back. This incident is notable as user complaints about model degradation are often unfounded, and Anthropic typically maintains model weights without version changes.

- [Quoting Benj Edwards](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/30/benj-edwards/#atom-tag) — The provided text conceptualizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as possessing "intelligence without agency," terming this "vox sine persona" (voice without person) to describe their nature as voices that originate from no specific individual. It also lists upcoming article titles, which include topics such as prompt injection vulnerabilities and the inconsistent performance of open-weight LLMs across various providers.
