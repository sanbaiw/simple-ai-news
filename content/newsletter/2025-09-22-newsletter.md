## Articles

- [The State of Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/the-state-of-llm-reasoning-model-training) — The article discusses the evolving landscape of Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, highlighting a shift from conventional models like GPT-4.5 and Llama 4, which rely heavily on scaling data and size, towards models enhanced with explicit reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning. It notes that companies like xAI and Anthropic are integrating reasoning capabilities, while OpenAI's o3 model demonstrates significant improvement through strategically applied RL. The piece emphasizes that reasoning, often involving chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, reliably boosts model accuracy and problem-solving, and is expected to become standard practice in future LLM pipelines, exploring specific RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO, and methodologies like RLHF and RLVR.

- [Noteworthy AI Research Papers of 2024 (Part One)](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/ai-research-papers-2024-part-1) — The article, "Noteworthy AI Research Papers of 2024 (Part One)," reviews influential Large Language Model (LLM) research from the first half of 2024, specifically highlighting January's paper: Mistral AI's "Mixtral of Experts." This paper introduced Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) model, notable for outperforming larger dense models like Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. The article details the MoE architecture, its efficiency benefits for scaling LLMs, and discusses its continued relevance in the AI landscape, citing recent adoptions like DeepSeek-V3, despite some state-of-the-art models still utilizing dense architectures.

- [New LLM Pre-training and Post-training Paradigms](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/new-llm-pre-training-and-post-training) — This article reviews the latest advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training and post-training methodologies, focusing on the pipelines of four recently released state-of-the-art models: Alibaba's Qwen 2, Apple Intelligence Foundation Language Models, Google's Gemma 2, and Meta AI's Llama 3.1. It details how LLM training has evolved, incorporating supervised instruction fine-tuning and alignment, popularized by ChatGPT. The analysis begins with a deep dive into Qwen 2, covering its various parameter sizes, strong multilingual capabilities, significantly expanded vocabulary compared to models like Llama 2, and the extensive pre-training data volumes used, including insights into data filtering and mixing improvements.
