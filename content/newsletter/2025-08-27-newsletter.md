## Articles

- [Backend in a box](https://www.bensbites.com/p/backend-in-a-box) — This newsletter provides updates for AI builders, covering new features like ChatGPT's 'project-only' memory and Claude Code's '/context' command, alongside notes on users exploring Codex CLI with GPT-5. It highlights security concerns with agentic browsers, advocating for isolated environments, and introduces new AI-focused companies such as Modelence (a backend Typescript framework) and Airia (for secure enterprise AI agent deployment). The issue also curates a variety of AI/ML-related content, tools for tinkering (e.g., Triple Whale's Moby Agents, Synclabs' lipsync-2-pro), and development resources, including Microsoft's VibeVoice and Vercel AI Gateway, reflecting a rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.

- [Will Smith’s concert crowds are real, but AI is blurring the lines](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/26/will-smiths-concert-crowds/#atom-tag) — A controversy arose over the perceived size of Will Smith's concert audiences, initially attributed to misleading AI usage. It was later clarified that the audiences were real, but a combination of static-image-to-video AI models used by his team and YouTube's compression experiments created an uncanny valley effect, leading to doubts. The article also references other AI/ML topics, including prompt injections, inconsistent performance of open-weight LLMs, and the release notes for LLM 0.27 featuring GPT-5 and improved tool calling.
