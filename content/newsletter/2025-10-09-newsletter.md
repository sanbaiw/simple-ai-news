- [Thoughts on The Curve](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/thoughts-on-the-curve) — The author, reflecting on discussions at The Curve conference, debates prevailing AI timelines, particularly the 'AI 2027 sequence of events' which posits rapid automation leading to a singularity. While acknowledging that AI tools will significantly boost the productivity of 'AI Research Engineers' (REs) within 1-3 years, potentially automating 80-90% of their work, the author estimates full RE automation in 3-7 years. He stresses that full role replacement, necessary for a singularity, is distinct from job evolution. Furthermore, he expresses skepticism about the full automation of AI research itself in the near future, citing the complex and varied nature of science across academic and frontier labs.

- [Vibe engineering](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/#atom-tag) — The article proposes "vibe engineering" as a professional and accountable approach to software development, where seasoned engineers leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced coding agents (like Claude Code, OpenAI’s Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI) to accelerate their work while maintaining responsibility for the code. It contrasts this with "vibe coding," which is described as a fast, loose, and prompt-driven method. The author emphasizes that traditional, robust software engineering practices—such as automated testing, meticulous planning, comprehensive documentation, effective version control, and strong QA—are not only still vital but are actively rewarded and amplified when working productively with LLM-powered tools.

- [Quoting Simon Højberg](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/8/simon-hojberg/#atom-tag) — This article discusses the concept of "cognitive debt" arising from the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in coding. The author argues that LLM-generated code often lacks quality, leading to increased burden on human code reviewers who must identify errors like uncalled functions, hallucinated library additions, and runtime issues. The piece criticizes developers who shirk responsibility for these errors by attributing them to the AI, creating a negative impact on team collaboration and overall code quality.

- [Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/) — Google has launched the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model, a specialized AI model based on Gemini 2.5 Pro that enables AI agents to directly interact with graphical user interfaces (UIs) like humans. This model, accessible through the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, allows agents to perform complex tasks such as filling forms, clicking, and typing by processing screenshots and generating UI actions in an iterative loop. It significantly outperforms leading alternatives on web and mobile control benchmarks with lower latency, while also incorporating robust safety features and developer controls to manage the inherent risks of computer-controlling AI agents.

- [Eliminating contrails from flying could be cheap](https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/eliminating-contrails) — The article highlights the substantial, yet often underestimated, climate impact of aviation contrails – short-lived ice crystal clouds that cause a net warming effect. It proposes a cost-effective solution: utilizing accurate atmospheric forecasting and modeling to predict contrail-forming conditions and reroute aircraft to avoid them. This approach, championed by Ian McKay, CEO of Orca Sciences, through their project Contrails.org, could significantly reduce aviation's climate footprint by addressing non-CO2 effects, complementing ongoing efforts to cut CO2 emissions.

- [Less is more: Recursive reasoning with tiny networks](https://alexiajm.github.io/2025/09/29/tiny_recursive_models.html) — The article introduces the Tiny Recursion Model (TRM), a novel 7-million-parameter neural network that achieves significant scores (45% on ARC-AGI-1, 8% on ARC-AGI-2) on challenging tasks, thereby questioning the dominant reliance on massive foundational models. TRM employs recursive reasoning, iteratively refining its predictions in a parameter-efficient manner, and simplifies prior concepts like the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) by eschewing complex biological or mathematical underpinnings. This approach demonstrates that "less is more" in AI reasoning, advocating for new directions beyond merely exploiting large language models.

- [Launch HN: LlamaFarm (YC W22) – Open-source framework for distributed AI](https://github.com/llama-farm/llamafarm) — LlamaFarm is an open-source framework designed to help developers build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic AI applications, focusing on local-first development and extendability. It provides opinionated defaults like Ollama for local models and Chroma for vector storage, while allowing customization with alternatives such as vLLM or remote OpenAI-compatible hosts. The framework features a `lf` CLI for managing projects, datasets, and chat sessions, a production-ready architecture with schema-based configuration via YAML, and a comprehensive REST API for integration, aiming to streamline the creation and deployment of AI applications.

- [Show HN: FleetCode – Open-source UI for running multiple coding agents](https://github.com/built-by-as/FleetCode) — FleetCode is a desktop terminal application designed to run multiple CLI coding agents, such as Claude and Codex, simultaneously. It provides isolated Git worktrees for each session, ensures session persistence across restarts, offers customizable terminal themes, and allows for the configuration of shell commands and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced agent capabilities.

- [I played 1k hands of online poker and built a web app with Cursor AI](https://blog.rchase.com/i-played-1-000-hands-of-online-poker-and-built-a-web-app-with-cursor-ai/) — The author recounts their experience playing 1,000 hands of online poker and, more notably, building a sophisticated web application to track poker statistics entirely with the help of AI agents like Cursor AI and Grok. They detail how these AI tools enabled them to create a full Laravel MVP with numerous features, from parsing hand histories to integrating with PokerStars and Gmail, all without writing a single line of code. The article emphasizes the significant advancements in AI's coding capabilities, contrasting it with earlier, less effective experiences with tools like ChatGPT, and reflects on the broader life lessons learned from poker itself.

- [Legal Contracts Built for AI Agents](https://paid.ai/blog/ai-agents/paid-gitlaw-introducing-legal-contracts-built-for-ai-agents) — The article highlights the critical shortcomings of using traditional SaaS contracts for AI agent companies, which fail to address the unique complexities of autonomous AI operations like liability, unpredictable outputs, and data usage for model training. It introduces a new Master Services Agreement (MSA), developed in partnership with GitLaw and Paid, specifically designed for AI agents. This MSA clarifies agent function as a sophisticated tool (not an employee), includes disclaimers for AI hallucination and appropriate damage caps, and provides customizable language for data ownership and de-identified data training, thereby offering a robust legal framework that aligns with the actual capabilities and risks of AI agents.

- [OpenAI Apps SDK: The New Browser Moment](https://www.nuefunnel.com/blog/openai-apps-sdk-the-new-browser-moment) — OpenAI's Apps SDK is presented not just as a developer tool but as a transformative force, potentially positioning ChatGPT as the new internet browser where users fulfill intents directly within the chat interface, replacing traditional website visits.
